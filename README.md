# LcdDisplay

A simple Elixir library that allows you to control an [Liquid-crystal display (LCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display) like [Hitachi HD44780](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `lcd_display` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lcd_display, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/lcd_display](https://hexdocs.pm/lcd_display).
